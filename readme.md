This is an post explotation in powershell that i did a couple weeks ago, in order to make it work you need:
1- Open a powershell shell[it works on powershell v1] with admin rights and put:
set-executionpolicy unrestricted
And confirm to execute codes without restrictions
Then you can use the code to reproduce video from links(henneko) or download them in temp and then reproduce them(henneko vidget) or download them from pastebin (henneko get)[the code should be in base64], decode it and then execute it.
I have made some builders in python3 but they are still a litle not too user friendly and the code stil needs refining.
To make the run last longer just copy paste sleep 1 and checkplayer inside the chepeat function.
Btw: The windows media player should be already configured.
All the versions have improvements:
Version 1 Still showed the console and it could stop the code just by closing the powershell shell.
Version 2 Did not showed the console anymore, had a thing that when the computer was about to turn off but it had some unsaved work you could cancel it over there.
Version 3 Now it forces the computer to shutdown.
